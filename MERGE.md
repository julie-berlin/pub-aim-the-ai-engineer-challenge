## 🧪 Post-Merge Testing

After merging, test the following functionality:

1. **PDF Upload**:
   - Upload a PDF file via drag-and-drop
   - Verify processing completes successfully
   - Check document appears in sidebar

2. **RAG Chat**:
   - Select an uploaded document
   - Ask questions about the document content
   - Verify responses are contextually relevant

3. **Document Management**:
   - List uploaded documents
   - Switch between different documents
   - Delete documents

4. **Regular Chat**:
   - Ensure regular chat still works without document selection
   - Verify mode switching works correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Processing Fails**:
   - Check if PyPDF2 is installed: `pip install PyPDF2`
   - Verify PDF file is not corrupted
   - Check file size limits (10MB max)

2. **Vector Database Errors**:
   - Ensure numpy is installed: `pip install numpy`
   - Check OpenAI API key is valid
   - Verify aimakerspace library path

3. **Frontend Build Issues**:
   - Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
   - Check TypeScript compilation

### Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# Backend
